1) Kruskals Algorithm for Min spanning Tree
      Implemented using Union find data structures
      Used Adjacency list for representing output spanning tree
      
2) Dijkstra Algorithm for Single source shortest path
      Implemented using Adjacency matrix representation
      
3) Prims Algorithm for Min Spanning Tree
      Similar to Dijkstra Algo, but outputs a Min spanning tree
